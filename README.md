## TrademarkPublicData
Utilities which support the processing of XML based USPTO trademark bulk download files

## Overview

The USPTO makes trademark data available to the public on both its own Bulk Data Download System Site as well as the external Reed Tech USPTO data portal.
The TM applications data is made available in XML format on a daily as well as annual basis. 
The collection of ZIP files on the Reed Tech site contains both the  daily  XML files(front files) as well as the annual XML files(back file). The  XML files are created and uploaded daily and contain pending and registered trademark text data including word mark, serial number, registration number, filing date, registration date, goods and services, classification number(s), status code(s) and design search code(s).  
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://patents.reedtech.com/tmappxml.php">Reed Tech IP Services, "USPTO Data Portal: Trademark Daily + Annual  XML Files - Applications"</a></b></li>
</ul>

The annual XML application files are available on both  the USPTO Bulk Data Storage System site as well as the Reed Tech site  and contain files with TM XML application data from April 7, 1884 to 2017:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/trademark/dailyxml/applications/">USPTO Bulkdata Daily + Annual Trademark XML(Front + Back Files)</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://patents.reedtech.com/tmappxml.php#1884-2017">Reed Tech Annual Trademark XML (Back files)</a></b></li>
</ul>


The TM annual bulk download application  files are available for download from either the USPTO Bulk Data Site or the Reed Tech site and consist of a series of ZIP files containing all trademark data from April 7, 1884  through the last day of the previous year. Once unzipped, the concatenated XML files range in size from roughly 400 MB to 3 GB and contain upwards of 80,000 trademark records per file. The files are too large to be opened with most standard text editors or IDEs for viewing.  Some commercial XML tools such as Oxygen XML Editor support viewing files of this size but these tools require a license.
There are currently 55 TM annual application ZIP files in the series containing all trademark data through the end of 2018. The annual TM files can be distinguished from the daily TM XML ZIP files available on the site by the file names. Annual files are named using the last day of the year following by the series number (1-59):
<br>
<br>i.e.
<br>
apc18840407-20181231-01.zip
<br>
<br>apc18840407-20181231-55.zip
<br>
<br>
Daily XML application files are named using the date with no series number:
<br>
i.e.
<br>apc190101.zip

<br>
The trademark splitter is a Python based utility which separates out the trademarks contained within each bulk download application file and then builds a corpus using a directory structure based on name and date of the ZIP file. The utility currently supports both the TM daily bulk download files(front files)  as well as the TM annual bulk download files (back files). The Python TM splitter tool uses a buffered reader to read and process the large XML input file in chunks so it won’t run out of memory.
<br>
For each individual trademark extracted from the bulk application XML file, the TM splitter creates  2 files:
<ul>
<li><b>complete trademark containing all fields in USPTO standard trademark XML format</b></li>
<li><b>file containing a subset of fields in Solr ready XML format</b></li>
</ul>
The splitter uses regular expressions to match and extract the fields that are then exported to Solr ready XML format. Fields currently supported by the tool include  the following:
<ul>
<li><b>trademark serial number used as the unique document id in Solr</b></li>
<li><b>mark name</b></li>
<li><b>mark drawing code</b></li>
<li><b>design codes</b></li>
<li><b>goods and services codes and descriptions</b></li>

## Required software
The tool was built and tested using Python 3.6  which can be downloaded from <b><a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a></b>.
<br>Install Python 3.6 and run the following command from a command/terminal/shell window in order to confirm the version :
<br>
C:\TrademarkPublicData\TMProcessing>python -V
<br>
Python 3.6.0

## Data download
The tool can be tested with the following trademark annual application XML input file:
<br>
<br>
<b><a href="https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/trademark/dailyxml/applications/apc18840407-181231-55.zip">apc18840407-apc181231-55.zip</a></b>
<br>
<br>
Unzip the file to a location with plenty of storage and confirm that there is an XML file of the same name:
<br>
i.e. e:\TMData\Applications_XML\apc18840407-181231-55.zip

<br>
The annual XML ZIP files are named using the last day of the previous year and the sequence number. For example, the file “acp18840407-181231-55.zip” is one of 55 files that together represent a snapshot of all USPTO registered trademarks as of Dec. 31, 2017. This sample file contains 82,652 trademark records. It is 106 MB zipped and 1.72 GB unzipped.

<br>
The tool can be tested with the following trademark daily XML input file:
<br>
<b><a href="https://bulkdata.uspto.gov/data/trademark/dailyxml/applications/apc190329.zip">apc190329.zip</a></b>
<br>
Unzip the file and confirm that there is an XML file with the same name:
<br>
i.e. apc190329.xml
<br>
Daily XML files are named using the date with no series number and only contain trademark records for a single day. This file contains records for all trademark transactions for March 29th, 2019.

<br>
The complete set of annual XML files form a snapshot of the USPTO public trademark data as of the last day of the previous year. In order to build an up to date trademark corpus representing all publicly available trademark data, the splitter must first process all annual XML files.  The splitter can then process all daily XML files up to the previous day which includes all changes since the snapshot was published on the last day of the previous year.

## Running the tool
Copy the Python script to the same directory at the XML test data:
<br>
i.e. C:\TrademarkPublicData\TMProcessing\tm_splitter.py

<br>
Launch a command line tool such as the Windows command prompt, Cygwin or other shell window.
<br>
Navigate to the installation directory:
<br>
$ cd C:\TrademarkPublicData\TMProcessing

<br>
Run the utility by providing the name of the input XML file and location of output directory as command line arguments:

<br>
$python tm_splitter.py -i e:\TMData\Applications_XML\apc18840407-181231-55.xml -d c:\tm_corpus

<br>
The utility will echo status messages to standard output as it builds a trademark corpus under the directory specified on the command line using the input file:
<br>
Number of arguments:  5 arguments
<br>
Argument List: ['D:\\TrademarkPublicData\\TMProcessing\\tm_splitter.py', '-i', 'e:\\TMData\\Applications_XML\\apc18840407-181231-56-87275954.xml', '-d', 'c:\\tm_corpus']

</ul>
